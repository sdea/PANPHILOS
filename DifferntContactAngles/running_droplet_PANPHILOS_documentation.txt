The simulation of a “self-propelling” droplet was simulated as described in [1]. 
The motion of the droplet on a flat surface is due to unbalanced surface tensions 
obtained by imposing different contact angles on the left and right side of the droplet. 
The kinetics of the process is governed by the conserved Cahn-Hilliard equation.
The smoothed boundary method (SBM) is used to solve the following equation.

? ??/?t=M?·[??(?f/??-e^2/? ?·(???)+e|??|/? v2f cos?)]

Where ? is the domain parameter used in the SBM framework, ? is the order parameter for 
the droplet in the phase field modelling, M is the mobility factor,  f is the energy 
density, e is the gradient energy coefficient and ? is the contact angle between the 
flat interface and the droplet. 
A grid spacing ?x=1 was used for the simulation performed on a domain of 250 along the 
x axis direction and 200 in the y axis direction. The initial radius of the droplet was 
chosen equals to 40 grid points. A mobility factor of 2 and e^2=0.2 were used. The energy 
density was expressed through a double well potential f(?)=Q/4 ?^2 (1-?)^2 where Q is the 
height reached by the potential between the two minimum free energy states. 
Spatial dependent boundary conditions for the contact angle were imposed, a contact angle 
of 45 degrees was imposed on the left side of the drop and 60 degrees were imposed on the 
right side of the computational domain. With this setup the surface energies balance, 
expressed by the Young´s equation, satisfies the two following equations

?_we-?_wd=?_de cos45       for the left side
?_we-?_wd=?_de cos60   for the right side

Where ?_we, ?_wd and ?_de are the surface energies for the wall-environment, wall-droplet 
and droplet-environment, respectively. The model proposed can be used for simulating cases 
where the surface energies depend on the position. 
The hemispherical droplet relaxes from the initial condition when the contact angle with 
the surface is 90 degrees reaching the imposed contact angle boundary conditions. Once 
completely relaxed the droplet starts moving toward left (i.e. lower contact angle and 
therefore lower surface energy between the wall and the droplet). The droplet motion was 
considered to be the effect of unbalanced surface tensions due to variation of composition 
and composition-dependent surface tensions in the space [2].
